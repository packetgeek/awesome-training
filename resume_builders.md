# Resume Builders

Following are various thoughts/recommendations for developing your resume entries.  The idea with much of the following is to make yourself "stand out" by doing things that most others don't.  Don't stop taking classes (ever!). 

## Join
* Join your local professional organizations.  While it may not qualify as a resume entry, you'll be networking with your peers, who may be looking for volunteers.
* Join your local geeks.  Pick a topic, use it to search [MeetUp.com](https://www.meetup.com/) to see if there's an interest group near you. (I was surprised to learn that Hampton Roads had its own Docker Captain (hi Brett!)).

## Train
* It's okay to pursue the shiny stuff but be sure to keep building towards your next degree.  If your employer supports tuition assistance, take advantage of it.  For the .mil types, if you're E-6 or below, there's no excuse (even deployment) as tuition assistance and Pell Grants will ofter cover everything but gasoline to/from evening classes.
* Acutally read the notices from the HR and training departments.  There's usually free classes being offered.  They may not align with what you're interested in but they tend to expand your skill set.
* Take Udemy classes.  They're usually cheap (starting at $10), quick, and cover the basics.
* Take [Pentester Academy](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/topics) courses.  They cost a bit more (~$150) and cover some of the more esoteric topics.  If you can't afford the cost, read the fine print.  They often put the content on Youtube (i.e., you get the training but not the tests or certificate).

## Volunteer
* Review others' documents
- NIST is always looking for comments on their [draft publications](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/draft-pubs).  ***Note:*** you don't have to be an expert but you do need to understand basic concepts. (I once caught an author describing an OR gate when the intent was to describe an AND gate.)
* Be a technical editor/reviewer for a book.  Search Google for "technical editor wanted".  This one requires some expertise in the subject but basics in other fields helps (e.g., knowing tools/fruits/targets of a crime when editing a wireless book).  It also helps to have a test range (or even just a Type 2 hypervisor).
* Lend a hand at your local CTF event (e.g., the annual Palmetto competition in Charleston, SC).
* Volunteer as a [RoadTester](https://www.element14.com/community/groups/roadtest?ICID=menubar_build_roadtest-reviews) (i.e., hardware reviewer) at Element14.  While most of their Road Tests require advanced training, they sometimes offer some less complicated hardware.  (I've reviewed at least one Raspberry Pi, a DLP projector, and some I2C hardware.)
* Volunteer to support your local CyberPatriot team(s) or similar.  Those often include to specific classes (e.g., Cisco Academy).
