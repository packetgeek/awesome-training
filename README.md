# awesome-training

*** Work in progress***

This started as a list for work but it applies to other people (Red/Blue Teams, vulnerability testers, RE types, analysts, etc.).  What you'll find here is lists of links to training sources, hints for resume builders, and/or other things that I find interesting.
