# awesome-training

*** Work in progress***

This started as a list for work/school but it applies to other people/professions (Red/Blue Teams, vulnerability testers, RE types, analysts, etc.).  Primary audience is the student but there's other good stuff here.

What you'll find here is lists of links to training sources, hints for resume builders, and/or other interesting info, relating to training and advancement.
